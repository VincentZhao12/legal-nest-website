# Legal Nest

Today, we often see incidents of police violence and discrimination against the African American community and other minority groups. This Website / App will function to document and share questionable encounters with law enforcement, and also recieve advice on what actions to take during and after encounters with the police.

### The Website

On the website users will be able to view other users' encounters with police and give advice. The website will also contain a section with your rights during encounters with law enforcement to allow the user to be more informed in future interactions with police.

#### To Run (development)

Have node installed on your computer

```
npm install
```

Put .env.local file with firebase environment variables in project directory

```
npm start
```
